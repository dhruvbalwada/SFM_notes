## Vertical Velocities

The vertical component of the velocity has received a lot of, maybe unnecessary (we should be thinking of the velocity as a whole, specially given the ocean's strong adiabatic constrain), attention in the oceanographic literature in the last few years.

Instantaneous velocity can be conceptually broken into two parts, a part that projects along isopycnals and a part that projects across them. 

Here we follow Young (2012) to project velocity into isopycnal coordinates.
